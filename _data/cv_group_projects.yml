    Have some other patches that were not published yet, including requirement to have tags to create a ticket, helm(k8s) deployment, nginx delivery of static content - ie only /api/ is delivered by trudesk itself.

  company: eZLO LTD
  info: Our client was manufacturing and selling an alarm panel, with no WiFi capability - only 3g/4g SIM. We had to make a setup that was secure and accomodated client requests.<br />
    The SIM was provisioned in a different APN, with no access to DNS or any external service; it was only allowed to access specific IP addresses (which were private)
